# BaoLQ4's Travel Planner App

# udacity-blq4-tpa

This project aims to give you the opportunity to put all of the skills you have learned into one project to build your own custom travel app. Due to the nature of this course, it is very JavaScript heavy, but it is still expected you create clean and appealing HTML/CSS. You will also be targeting the DOM, working with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers.

The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience along the way:

- What’s the ideal workflow?
- How many files do I need?
- How do I convert one project into another?
- Should I redo the HTML/CSS first or go straight to the javascript?
- How many JavaScript functions do I need?
- Should my function be this many lines of code?
- Is readability or performance more important?
